In this notebook I explore the EDA's air pollution monitoring
network in the downtown LA area to answer three questions:
Are there any particular days with high levels of PM2.5 in 
2016?
What does the chemical makeup of PM2.5 in 2016 look like?
What kind of trends do we see in PM2.5 from year to year?
